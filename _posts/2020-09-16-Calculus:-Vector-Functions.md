## Vector Calculus
To study the calculus of vector-valued functions, we follow a similar path to the one we took in studying real-valued functions.

First, we define the derivative, then we examine applications of the derivative, then we move on to defining integrals.

However, we will find some interesting new ideas along the way as a result of the vector nature of these functions and the properties of space curves.
